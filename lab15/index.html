      <h1>Lab 15: Object-Oriented Design</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this lab is for us to work with our partner to create a JavaScript Constructor. This is similar to what we did
				in the previous lab, where we worked with JavaScript Classes and Objects, except for this lab we are using classes instead of prototypes.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I didn't experience too many problems with this lab since most of the ground work was already done during the previous
				lab and we went over this lab in class with Wes. I am experinceing some problems with an "unexpected end of input" with my
				JS but hopefully I can figure out how to solve the problem.

</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Here are the results:</p>

				 <li>Set up game board</li>
				 <li>Game loop</li>
				 <li>Draw board</li>
				 <li>Generate a word</li>

		 <li>Pseudocode the High Level Approach</li>
			 <pre>
Set up game initially
 Create game
 Create players
Start the game loop
 Render the board
 Generate a word
 Display word length
 Get letters from players
 If letter is correct
	 Display letter on line
 Else
	 Draw stick figure body parts
	 Display wrong letters
 If game should end
	 Display victory/loss message
	 Stop looping
 Else
	 Keep looping
			 </pre>

		 <li>Assign Actions to Objects</li>

		 <pre>
Set up game initially [Hangman]
Create game [Board]
Create players [Player]
Start the game loop [Hangman]
Render the board [Board]
Generate a word [Hangman]
Display word length [Board]
Get letters from players [Player]
If letter is correct [Board]
 Display letter on line [Board]
Else
 Draw stick figure body parts [Board]
 Display wrong letters [Board]
If game should end [Hangman]
 Display victory/loss message
 Stop looping
Else
 Keep looping [Hangman]

		 <li>Make Javascript-ish Pseudocode</li>

		 <pre>
class Hangman
initialize
	 set up the board
	 set up the players
	 assign starting player

play
	 loop infinitely
			 call the board rendering method
			 generate a word
			 display word length
			 get letters from players
			 validate letters

check_game_over
	 check_victory
	 check_loss

check_victory
	 if board says the word is correct
			 display victory message

check_loss
	 if board says the stick figure is complete
			 display loss message
