<h1> Lab  10: JavaScript for Web </h1>
<p> Big Idea:  The main ideas of this lab is being about to <br>
	write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.
	Create a new element with document.createElement and assign it to a variable new1El. <br>
	Change the html attribute of new1El to say something new. </p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> The lab was definitely very difficult as it toomk a lot of adapting and learning new functions. <br>
		My partner and I both had problems so we'll have to figure it out during class. </p>
	<h2> Results: </h2>
 <p> Here are the results </p>

 <div>
	 <label for="input-name">input name:</label>
	 <input id = "user-name">
	 <br>
	 <button id="my-button"> Submit</button>

	 <div id="output"> </div>
