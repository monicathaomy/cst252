<h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>
<p> Big Idea:  The main ideas of this lab is being about to <br>
	write functions that take user input and manipulate a string. <br>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> The lab was definitely very difficult as it toomk a lot of adapting and learning new functions. <br>
		My partner and I both had problems so we'll have to figure it out during class. </p>
	<h2> Results: </h2>
	<p> Program execution:</p>
