 				<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocodingand Problem-solving </h1>

			<h2>Big Idea</h2>
				<p>The big idea for this lab is to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding. <br>
					Starting with pseudocode an everyday task, and with the help of my partner, we will pseudocode an everyday task accompanied by a ccomputer task. <br></p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p> For this lab, we were a little conflicted at first about which “everyday task” we wanted to do, then Ayline suggested we should do something simple<br>
					 and sweet like making lemonade, so we agreed on that. We did have a little trouble trying to figure out <br>
					 how to do the second part of the lab, the computer task.  </p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> The results were very successfully, everything worked as plan! As seen in
					the document presented! <br>
					<br>
					↓ Our everyday pseudocode:<br>
					<br>
			<h1>		MAKING LEMONADE:</h1><br>
				1. Cut lemons in half <br>
			  2. 	Squeeze lemons in a pitcher <br>
			  3. 	Add water <br>
				4.  Add sugar <br>
			  5. 	Mix<br>
				6.  Add ice or refrigerate <br>
				7.  Pour into cups <br>
				8.  Sip, enjoy<br>

			<br>
			<h1> CONVERTING METERS INTO FEET:</h1> <br>
			1. Input meter value (M) <br>
			2. Calculate feet(F):<br>
			3. Multiply M by 3.2808 <br>
		  4. Output the value of F <br>
			5. Stop <br>
			<br>
			JavaScript Code: <br>
			// Input meter value (M) <br>
				// Calculate feet(F):<br>
					// Multiply M by 3.2808 <br>
						// Output the value of F <br>
							// Stop <br>
