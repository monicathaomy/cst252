<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for Web </h1>
<p> Big Idea:  The main ideas of this lab is being about to <br>
	write functions that take user input and manipulate a string. By doing these commands: <br>
	Put a comment block at the top of your program, use getElementById() to find your output and assign it to a variable outputEl.<br>
	Create a new element with document.createElement and assign it to a variable new1El. <br>
	Change the html attribute of new1El to say something new. </p>

	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> The lab was definitely very difficult as it toomk a lot of adapting and learning new functions. <br>
		My partner and I both had problems so we'll have to figure it out during class. </p>
	<h2> Results: </h2>
	<p> Program execution:</p>
	<div id = "output" >
		<h3>Script Output </h3>

		<script src="js/lab9.js"></script>
	</div>
