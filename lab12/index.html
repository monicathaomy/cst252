      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this lab is for us to work with our partners to experiment with new JavaScript code,
				 specifically Loops. Loops work with JavaScript statements such as "for", and "while". Within these loops it is also possible to have "if",
				  "else if", and "else" statements.</p>
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> A challenge that I encountered was time mangement, because I had to rewatch the lecture and also
					linking my javascript, as it said 404 error for a few tries. <p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Here are the results:</p>
