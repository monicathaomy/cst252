	  <h1 style="color:#ba95df;">~ Hello World! ~ </h1>
      <p style="color:#84a6f0;">My name is Monica To and I'm
      a second year Communication Design student as well as business student
      at Cal State Monterey Bay. My concentration for Communication Design is in Visual Design.
      I'm eager to add more knowledge on how to code and create
      websites with Professor Wes. My creative side involves
      painting, drawing, and digital designing. For leisure Ilove to swim, and do makeup and go on coffee dates or
			just find myself indugling in a lot of iced coffee.
